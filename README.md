# Event-Driven-Signal-Handler-C-MQL
Overview

The Event Driven Signal Handler System is a sophisticated software solution designed to automate the retrieval, processing, and execution of financial signals from various online platforms, with a primary focus on Discord. The application integrates multiple technologies, including the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) for the user interface, the .NET Core ASP API for backend processing, and MQL5 for executing trades in the MetaTrader 5 trading platform. This project aims to provide a streamlined, user-friendly experience for traders and investors who wish to capitalize on timely market signals.

Challenges Faced

While developing this application, several challenges were encountered, which required innovative solutions:

Restrictions on Bot Usage: 

Telegram imposes limitations on bot functionalities within certain groups, preventing the direct fetching of trading signals. To overcome this, the application employs a Notification Listener that captures relevant messages from Discord channels, enabling the user to work around the limitations.

Data Synchronization: 

Ensuring real-time synchronization between incoming signals and trading operations required a robust architecture for data handling. The application must handle multiple concurrent requests and maintain the integrity of trading operations.

User Experience Design: 

Crafting an intuitive UI that allows users to easily configure settings, input group chat names, and specify listening platforms was crucial. This necessitated careful consideration of layout, usability, and responsiveness.

Error Handling and Logging: 

Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms was vital to identify and resolve issues promptly, ensuring reliable operation during trading hours.

Technologies Used

The application leverages the following technologies:

UWP (Universal Windows Platform):

The front end is developed using UWP, providing a responsive and visually appealing interface for Windows devices.
Features include input fields for group chat names, buttons for starting/stopping the listener, and configuration settings for trading parameters.

.NET Core ASP API:

The backend is powered by a .NET Core ASP API, which handles HTTP requests for sending and retrieving financial signals.
The API consists of multiple endpoints, including a POST endpoint for receiving signals and a GET endpoint for fetching stored JSON data.

MQL5 (MetaQuotes Language 5):

MQL5 scripts execute trading operations based on signals processed from the API.
The scripts manage the logic for trade execution, risk management, and position monitoring, ensuring that trades are executed in a timely and efficient manner.

JSON for Data Transfer:

The application uses JSON format for data exchange between the UWP frontend, the ASP API, and the MQL5 scripts, facilitating easy parsing and manipulation of data.
Architecture

The application architecture can be broken down into three main components:

User Interface (UWP Application):

Users interact with the application through the UWP interface, where they can input chat names, select platforms, and configure trading parameters.
The UI communicates with the ASP API to send user configurations and receive trading signals.

Backend (ASP API):

The ASP API acts as the intermediary between the UWP application and the MQL5 scripts.
It processes incoming signals from the user interface and provides stored signals to the MQL5 scripts.
The API handles requests and responses, ensuring that data flows seamlessly between components.

Trading Logic (MQL5 Scripts):

The MQL5 scripts are responsible for executing trades in the MetaTrader 5 platform based on signals received from the ASP API.
These scripts implement risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss and take-profit levels, and managing open positions.
Data Flow

The data flow within the application involves the following steps:

Signal Reception:

The UWP application listens for financial signals posted in specified Discord channels through a Notification Listener.
Captured messages are parsed and sent to the ASP API for storage and processing.

Data Processing:

The ASP API processes the received signals, storing them for retrieval by MQL5 scripts.
The API ensures that all signals are formatted correctly and are ready for execution.

Execution of Trades:

MQL5 scripts periodically query the ASP API to check for new signals.
Upon receiving a signal, the scripts execute the appropriate trades, applying risk management parameters configured by the user.

Trade Management:

The application continuously monitors open trades, applying rules for breakeven adjustments and partial closures based on user settings.
User Interface Elements

The UWP application features several key user interface elements:

Input Fields: 

Users can enter the names of Discord channels they wish to monitor for financial signals.

Platform Selection: 

Options to select the trading platforms (e.g., Discord) for receiving signals.

Configuration Settings:

Risk management settings allow users to define parameters such as risk percentage, lot size, and breakeven points.
Options for partial closures of trades are also provided.
Status Indicators: The UI includes indicators to show the current status of the application, such as connection status and active trading operations.

Notification Area: 

Users receive alerts and notifications for important actions, such as successful trade execution or errors encountered during processing.

Conclusion

The Financial Signal Automation System is a powerful tool that automates the retrieval and execution of financial signals from various platforms. By leveraging UWP for the user interface, .NET Core for backend processing, and MQL5 for executing trades, the application provides a seamless experience for users looking to enhance their trading strategies.

This project exemplifies how modern technologies can be combined to solve real-world challenges in financial trading, offering a scalable and efficient solution for signal processing.
