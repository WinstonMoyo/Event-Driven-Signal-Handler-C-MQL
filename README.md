# Event-Driven-Signal-Handler-C-MQL
A multi-platform event-driven system that processes and relays signals from various communication platforms like Telegram. Built with UWP for the user interface, .NET Core ASP.NET API for backend operations, and MQL5 for executing logic, this project demonstrates efficient real-time data flow and modular architecture for extensibility.
